    "üìñ Story: Bag of Words\n",
    "Let's say you and your friends wrote these two sentences:\n",
    "\n",
    "1Ô∏è‚É£ \"I love cricket\"\n",
    "2Ô∏è‚É£ \"I love playing cricket\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, imagine you take all the words from both sentences and put them into a bag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Your bag will look like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "css\n",
    "Copy\n",
    "Edit\n",
    "[\"I\", \"love\", \"cricket\", \"I\", \"love\", \"playing\", \"cricket\"]\n",
    "But a bag doesn‚Äôt care about order, right? If you mix the toffees, you don‚Äôt remember who threw them first.\n",
    "So, you just count how many of each word you have, like counting candies. üç≠\n",
    "\n",
    "üèè Example Table\n",
    "Word\tCount\n",
    "I\t2\n",
    "love\t2\n",
    "cricket\t2\n",
    "playing\t1\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called a Bag of Words (BoW) because:\n",
    "\n",
    "We ignore the order of words. (Doesn‚Äôt matter if you said \"love cricket\" or \"cricket love\")\n",
    "\n",
    "We just count how many times each word appeared, like counting candies.\n",
    "\n",
    "üß† Why is this useful?\n",
    "Computers don‚Äôt understand language like we do.\n",
    "\n",
    "BoW gives them numbers to work with.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 1 = [1, 1, 1, 0] (no \"playing\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Sentence 2 = [1, 1, 1, 1] (has \"playing\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the computer can do math to compare sentences! ‚úÖ\n",
    "\n",
    "üéØ Real-life Example\n",
    "Suppose you are analyzing your friends' chat messages:\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat 1: \"I like samosa\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat 2: \"I like dosa\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Bag of words helps you count and compare:\n",
    "\n",
    "Word list: [\"I\", \"like\", \"samosa\", \"dosa\"]\n",
    "\n",
    "Counts:\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat 1 ‚Üí [1, 1, 1, 0]\n",
    "\n",
    "Chat 2 ‚Üí [1, 1, 0, 1]\n",
    "\n",
    "So you know:\n",
    "\n",
    "Both friends like food (I, like) üçΩÔ∏è\n",
    "\n",
    "One likes samosa, the other dosa üòÑ\n",
    "\n",
    "üí° Think of Bag of Words = A bag filled with words like candies, where only the count matters, not the order.\n",
